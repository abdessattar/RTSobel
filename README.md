This is an image processing project. It simulates the Sobel edge detection algorithm. 
Sobel is the most famous edge detection operator. It consists of a set of mathematical methods that works for identifying points in a digital image at which the

image brightness changes sharply or, more formally, has discontinuities. These
points are typically organized into a set of curved line segments termed edges.
So our task will be to find an optimized hardware solution to implement
this algorithm so that it can perform a real-time edges detection!

Key words: VHDL, ModelSim, Sobel algorithm,etc
